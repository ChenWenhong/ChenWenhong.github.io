  Hello,everyone. Welcome to my blog. My name is Wenhong Chen and I am currently living at Cardiff, UK. Broadly speaking my interests focuses on iOS Development and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in applications to the domain of automatic patch generation which developed by MIT.

## About Machine Learning

Prophet is an algorithm to go through lines of code and to automatically fix bugs in the code. I am following this project now.

## About iOS Development

As I mentioned at home page, I developed 4 universal iOS applications when I lived in my hometown, Shenzhen.

You can download them on app Store.

Although it seems like that I have rich experience in iOS development, I think I am still a beginner. It is because that I still know little about iOS development in every aspects, Objective-C and Swift language, or CocoaTouch.

## Summary
However, it is not easy to make progress on these areas and I must study continuously and advance with the time.

Thanks for reading!
