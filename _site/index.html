      <p class="lead">I am a MSC student who study Advanced Computer Science at Cardiff University. In the past, I developed 4 universal iOS applications which can be downloaded on app store. Most of my experience is with Objective-C, Python and Swift. I enjoy learning Machine Learning and algorithm for leisure. Although I am still a beginner in these areas, I have strong and contiuous learning capability and adaptility.</p>

    <p>As a second-language English speaker, it is difficult for me to write blog in English. I am appreciated that my father and mother support me study abroad so that I have the opportunity to communicate with native English speaker. Although I didnâ€™t have a satisfactory result in university, I still found a good job when I graduated from school. I worked for a IT company as an iOS developer until I planned to study abroad with my girlfriend. I gained experience of software development from this job and developed a wide range of coding interests so I applied the major of Advance Computer Science with no hesitate.</p>

<p>After one semester, I become interested in Machine Learning and recognized that I have to devote into this with my utmost endeavor so that I can become familiar with this area.</p>

<p>I will write something about learning outcomes at this blog. I hope that I can write articles which have sufficient breadth and depth and useful to others who also have interest in Machine Learning.</p>
