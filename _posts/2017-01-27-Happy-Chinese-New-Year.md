title: Happy Chinese New Year!
category: Normal
---

Today is Chinese New Year's Eve. It is a special day for Chinese and it is the first time that I celebrate this festival without my parents but with my girlfriend. 2016 has been a great year, and 2017 will be greater for both of us.

In 2017, I have 2 goals which related to my study and personal career. The first thing is to build an iOS application which main language is Swift and has a perfect user experience. Although it is hard to achieve this goal, as a result-oriented developer, I have to try my best. This application is a diary application which function is similar to five year diary.

Another thing is to understand popular Machine Learning algorithms and probably best if I build a project which based on them. I have some amazing learning materials such as * [Berkeley's Machine Learning blog](http://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/) and a good project * [Prophet](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pac/patchgen/). As As far as I concerned, I probably underestimate the difficult of studying Machine Learning. I read a * [paper](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pac/patchgen/papers/kali-issta2015.pdf) which makes a brief view of project Prophet, it is really complicated. However, I will take Data Mining and Pattern Recognition course this semester which may help me understand those difficult concepts about Data Science.

All in all, I wish all wishes will come true at 2017 and happy new year!
